        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pastelón, a traditional Puerto Rican lasagna-style dish made with layers of fried sweet plantains, sofrito, ground beef picadillo, pimento olives, and mozzarella cheese. Often called a sweet plantain lasagna, this baked dish is the perfect combination of crispy, creamy, sweet and salty.</p>

            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>
            6 large ripe plantains - peeled, halved, and each half cut lengthwise into 4 slices
            </li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>
1 (9 ounce) package frozen French cut green beans, thawed and drained
            </li>
            <li>
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove meat from pan; drain fat.
            </li>
            <li>
            Place tomato sauce, sofrito, green olives, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, recao, and oregano in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Return ground beef to skillet; reduce to a simmer. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes more.
</li>
            <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8- or 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
            Pour oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry plantain slices until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
            Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; add 1/2 teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>
            Line the bottom of the baking pan with half the plantains, overlapping as needed. Layer ground beef mixture, green beans, and remaining plantains; pour eggs on top. Top with mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
