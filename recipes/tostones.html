            Description
        </h2>
        <p>Tostones are a staple dish in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine, and are often served as appetizers or side dishes. They are made by peeling, slicing, cooking, and then smashing green plantains, and then cooking them again. The extra steps give tostones a unique nutty flavor, and they are larger, crunchier, and tastier than regular plantain chips. 
        </p>
        <p>Tostones are commonly known as tostones in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, U.S.A., Honduras, and Venezuela. In Cuba, they are also known as tachinos or chatinos, and in the Dominican Republic, they are known as platano frito or frito verde. </p>
