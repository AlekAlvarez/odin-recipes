        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Flan is a baked custard dessert with a layer of caramel on top. The base is made from eggs, milk or other dairy, sugar, and flavorings, and then poured into a mold or individual baking cups.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flan is cooked upside down, with the caramel sauce going into the baking dish first, then the custard mixture on top. Flan has a rich, toasted sugar caramel flavor from the topping and the base tastes very milky, perfectly sweet and lightly eggy. It is similar to creme brulee or panna cotta in taste, but texturally the three are quite different.
